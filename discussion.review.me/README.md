# The scenario

Imagine you are shopping in a supermarket. You have purchased a few items, and the bill has come to x-units of money.

The supermarket has decided to run a promotion deal, where, if the purchase amount is 1000-units or more, then during this promotion period, you'll be given a flat 20% discount on the bill.

The written program intends to do this.
