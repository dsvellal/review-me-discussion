# The scenario

Imagine a supermarket. You have purchased a few items, and it has costed you x-units of money. The supermarket has decided to run a promotion deal, where if the purchase amount is greater than or equal to 1000-units, then during this promotion period, the supermarket gives you 20% discound on the purchase amount.

The written program intends to do this.
