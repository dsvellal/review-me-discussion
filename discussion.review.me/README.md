# The scenario

Imagine you are shopping in a supermarket. You have purchased a few items, and the bill has come to x-units of money.

The supermarket has decided to run a promotion deal, where, if the purchase amount is 1000-units or more, then during this promotion period, you'll be given a flat 20% discount on the bill.

The program intends to do this.

Please see the [program here](https://github.com/dsvellal/review-me-discussion/blob/master/discussion.review.me/src/main/java/com/example/discussion/review/me/App.java) and it's relevant [test cases here](https://github.com/dsvellal/review-me-discussion/blob/master/discussion.review.me/src/test/java/com/example/discussion/review/me/AppTest.java)

Maven is used to build this, and the dependencies are defined in the [pom.xml here](https://github.com/dsvellal/review-me-discussion/blob/master/discussion.review.me/pom.xml)
